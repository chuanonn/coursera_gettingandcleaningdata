# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## Background Information
This repository contains work done on the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project.

The purpose of the course project is to test the abilities to collect, work with and clean a dataset.

## About the Dataset
Dataset used in this course project is "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone Data Set" in UCI Machine Learning Repository here: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

This dataset records the data generated by 30 participants performing daily living activities while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

## About the R script
A script named run_analysis.R is created to complete the following:
 1. Merge training and testing set into one complete data set.
 2. Extracts only the measurement on the mean and standard deviation.
 3. Label the data set columns with descriptive variable names.
 4. Label the activities in the data set with their respective descriptions.
 5. Aggregate the data set created with the average of each selected variables at activity and subject level.

The script will run under the assumption that
 1. UCI HAR Dataset is downloaded and extracted,
 2. Script named run_analysis.R is placed at the same directory as the UCI HAR Dataset.
